This code suffers from a race condition.  If multiple requests hit the `updateCounter` function concurrently, the counter might not be incremented correctly due to the lack of proper locking or atomic operations.  Each request reads the current counter value, increments it, and then writes it back.  If two requests do this simultaneously, they might both read the same value, increment it independently, and then write the same, incorrect value back.
